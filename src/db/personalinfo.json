    "about_me": "I enjoy a workout and playing basketball. Sweating is the best way to clear my head and energize myself for the rest of the day. After sweating and burning valuable calories, I love to regenerate myself by devouring a bowl of ramen (my favorite comfort food). Outside of the court, gym, and ramen restaurant, I would put my creativity to work by working on different full-stack projects by creating react web applications."
